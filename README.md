# Musical Key Estimation via Machine Learning
## Description
This is a complete, trained system that determines the key of any input music track. Training was done using a small subset of the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). For information about the system architecture and performance, see the writeup section below. Note that this system represents Architecture #2 from the paper, since it seemed to perform significantly better.

## Usage
Simply edit the song filepath in *main.m* to the location of the song that you want to process, then run the script.

## Dependencies
This project requires the *Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox* for MATLAB. It also needs the Chroma Toolbox, but I've included that here.
